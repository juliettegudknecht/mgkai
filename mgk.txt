“acting like that”
[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Who's that knockin' at four in the morning? (Four in the morning)
'Cause it don't rain, but tonight, it's pouring (Tonight, it's pouring)
Uh, you like it more when I ignore it (You like it, yeah)
And since I left, LA got boring (Since I've been gone)
Ayy, I'm back on my bullshit
You're a Libra, I'm a Taurus
Heard you hooked back up with your ex
And now you're asleep on my doorstep

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that
I don't wanna talk right now
You're asleep outside my house
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that

[Verse 2: YUNGBLUD]
(I love this bit)
I heard that today, you got on a plane to another state
I think I'm okay
Never gonna change my mind
Never gonna change my mind
And I don't think today is the last time
That the bright lights hit the dark side
I can see that look in your eyes
I can see that look in your eyes, yeah
Now I can't sleep, I'm all alone
And what we reaped was what we've sown
So can we meet somewhere in the middle? (Yeah)

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & YUNGBLUD, Machine Gun Kelly]
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that
I don't wanna talk right now (Right now)
You're asleep outside my house (Asleep outside my house)
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that

[Post-Chorus: YUNGBLUD & Machine Gun Kelly]
La-la, la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la (Yeah)

[Bridge: YUNGBLUD, Machine Gun Kelly & Both]
I'm going out my head
I fell in love again
I know that you'll regret me in the morning
When you are gone again
Yeah

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & YUNGBLUD, Machine Gun Kelly]
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that
I don't wanna talk right now (I don't wanna talk right now)
You're asleep outside my house (Asleep outside my house)
You're way too hot to be acting like that
Acting like that, acting like that

[Post-Chorus: YUNGBLUD & Machine Gun Kelly]
La-la, la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la (Yeah)
“Climb”
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I need you in the worst way
'Cause life gets boring
When you're not driving me crazy
Used to not wanna be here
So what if I leave here?
How will they ever locate me
I'd fall, might die within
Hold on, I'll rise again
I'd fall, might die within
But I'll rise again, I'll rise again

[Chorus: 24kGoldn & Machine Gun Kelly]
Once, I was yours and you were mine
We had time, time, time
Gotta make it outta here, make it out alive
We gotta climb, climb, climb
I will never leave you, never leave your side
Can we try, try, try
To make it outta here, make it out alive?
Can we climb, climb, climb?

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
I can't prepare myself for the fall I don't see coming
I can't repair my lungs after years of yelling for nothing
I can't prepare myself for the fall I don't see coming
I can't repair my lungs after years of yelling

[Chorus: 24kGoldn & Machine Gun Kelly]
Once, I was yours and you were mine (Were mine)
We had time, time, time (Time, time, time)
Gotta make it outta here, make it out alive (Alive)
We gotta climb, climb, climb (Climb, climb, climb)
I will never leave you, never leave your side (Your side)
Can we try, try, try (Try, try, try)
To make it outta here, make it out alive? (Alive)
Can we climb, climb, climb? (Climb, climb, climb)
“Empty Souls”
[Chorus: iann dior & Machine Gun Kelly]
Sex, drugs and empty souls (Empty souls)
Yeah, I've been down so long (So long)
Come on, let's go, let's go (Let's go)
Here we go, go, go again
Here we go, go, go again

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
The bar's open, I'm closed up
Had the same clothes on when I woke up
Ex girlfriend, just broke up
With her man tryna hit my phone up
We'll end up back where we started
Fucking on the living room couch
I guess I love you regardless
Fucking just to figure shit out, yeah
“F*CK YOU, GOODBYE”
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Wait, that was a lie
Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stone like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Machine Gun Kelly & Both]
Fuck you, goodbye (Yeah)
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
“banyan tree (interlude)”
[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly & Megan Fox]
My god
Did you drink a lot of tequila?
Yeah
Is that what it was?
Yeah
You wanna listen to the interlude while we sit here?
Yeah
Let it out
Do you, like, remember the stuff that you do with me?
Yes
Okay, I don't know 'cause you're so high or, like, you get really drunk, so I don't know if you remember it
Of course I do
Okay
I cherish it
I burn other memories just to make room for those ones
That was four months ago that we were right here and I met you
That's not possible
Like, you just got my initials tattooed on you
I got your nickname tattooed on me
Mhm

[Verse: Machine Gun Kelly]
She loves a boy so much
She wants him to steal her breath
She loves (She loves) a boy so much
She wants (She wants) him to steal her breath

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly & Megan Fox]
Because also
If the world was coming to an end
I don't wanna close my eyes without
Feeling like I lived
Same
“play this when i’m gone”
[Verse 1]
I'm writing you this message just so I can say that I love you
I had to let you know that everything about me was you, yeah
I think it's time for me to leave, but I'll never leave you
I just looked at your pictures, so the last thing I did was see you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm twenty-nine, my anxiety's eating me alive
I'm fightin' with myself and my sobriety every night
And last time I couldn't barely open up my eyes, I apologize

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna lie and tell you it's alright, it's alright
You're gonna cry and baby, that's alright, it's alright
I wrote you this song to keep when I'm gone
If you ever feel alone
You're gonna cry and baby, that's alright, it's alright

[Verse 2]
I hope you get to go to all the places that I showed you
When I was on the road and couldn't be home to hold you
Part of me doesn't want this cruel world to know you
So just try and keep in mind everything that I told you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm twenty-nine, and society's eating me alive
I'm fighting what comes with this notoriety every night
This is the last time I'll ever open up my eyes, I apologize

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna lie and tell you it's alright, it's alright
You're gonna cry and baby, that's alright, it's alright
I wrote you this song to keep when I'm gone
If you ever feel alone
You're gonna cry and baby, that's alright, it's alright

[Bridge]
And I'll miss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you, yeah
And I'll miss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you
And I'll miss you (I'll miss you), I'll miss you (I'll miss you)
I'll miss you (I'll miss you), I'll miss you, yeah
And I'll miss you (I'll miss you), I'll miss you (I'll miss you)
I'll miss you (I'll miss you), I'll miss you

[Outro]
And I'll miss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you, yeah
And I'll miss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you, I'll miss you
“drunk face”
[Chorus]
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on those drugs I quit
I kept my dealer's number
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on that girl I quit
I should've lost her number

[Verse 1]
I'm overcompensating for heartbreak
I swallowed a pill that wasn't a heart shape
Her hands on my chest, feelin' my heartbeat
She spillin' her drink all on my car seat
She'll get attached and then trap me
Then I gotta act like I'm happy
She posts pics to get at me
Déjà vu, this like last week

[Chorus]
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on those drugs I quit
I kept my dealer's number
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on that girl I quit
I should've lost her number

[Verse 2]
Pedal to the floor, yeah, I can't brake
The floor of the hotel's my ashtray
She opened the door and walked past me
I'm a Hollywood whore, I don't ask names
Yeah, let's get high as fuck
I'm trying to cover up
Eyes that have seen too much
I'd go blind for her touch

[Chorus]
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on those drugs I quit
I kept my dealer's number
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on that girl I quit
I should've lost her number

[Outro]
I'm still young
I'm wasted and I'm not getting younger
I'll grow up
I promise that I'll grow up next summer
I'm still young (You plus me is euphoria)
I'm wasted and I'm not getting younger
I'll grow up (I have sinned, don't help me, Jesus)
I promise that I'll grow up next summer
I'm still young (You plus me is euphoria)
I'm wasted and I'm not getting younger
I'll grow up (I have sinned, don't help me, Jesus)
I promise that I'll grow up next summer
“nothing inside”
[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I keep doing that thing where I'm thinking again
I got skeletons in my closet (Closet)
I got nightmares sleeping again
I gave you my heart, you lost it (Lost it)
She's a girl from a small town, but we're in a big city
And she's in my passenger seat right now
'Cause we live in a small world
I told her, "It's all yours"
But I need to know if you're down
I can't help it (I can't help it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I did this all for you, look what I turned into
She looked dead into my eyes and she saw nothing inside
I did this all for you, look what I turned into
She looked dead into my eyes and she saw nothing inside

[Verse 2: iann dior]
(Huh, yeah)
I keep doing that thing where I'm smoking again
Too much and now I'm faded
Keep tearing my heart, now it's open again
Few drunk texts, now you're naked
I can't help it, I can't help it
I feel selfish, I feel selfish (Selfish)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & iann dior]
I did this all for you, look what I turned into
She looked dead into my eyes and she saw nothing inside
I did this all for you, look what I turned into
She looked dead into my eyes and she saw nothing inside

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly & iann dior]
(It's hard)
It's been a long time since I was young
And she was the first face I was looking to call mine
She said it's alright, had a couple of drinks
And I got issues we can fight about all night

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I did this all for you, look what I turned into
She looked dead into my eyes and she saw nothing inside
I did this all for you, look what I turned into
She looked dead into my eyes and she saw nothing inside

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly]
I'm running low on serotonin in these empty moments
I'm having trouble operating without my main component
I'm running low on serotonin in these empty moments
I'm having trouble operating without my main component
“jawbreaker”

Jawbreaker
She tastes like candy
Star chaser

LA ex is
In Miami
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker

[Verse 1]
Would it kill you to smile?
Let me occupy your mind
Went a million miles an hour
And it fucked up your design

[Pre-Chorus]
6 AM, six a piece, then sex on the beach, uh
6 PM, sexy girl, still can't let her leave, uh
6 AM, back again for the same thing, ya

She tastes like candy

There's a movie on with no sound
I'm the architect of this town
You're the prototype I need now

[Pre-Chorus]
6 AM, six a piece, then sex on the beach, uh
6 PM, back again for the same things, yeah

“kevin and barracuda (interlude)”
[Machine Gun Kelly, Pete Davidson, Megan Fox]
Yo
Yo
Ok, wait, Pete, before we start, can you just give me some beep-boops, beep-boop-boop
Beep-boop-boop, beep-boop-boop-boop, beep-boop-boop, boop
What's, what's your alien name?
Roger, no, I'm gonna be Kevin, dude
I wanna be Kevin the alien
Why was mine such a bad name? Mine was Barracuda
Kevin and Barracuda, dude
I'm on, I'm like, coming down off mushrooms by the way
Oh, that's great
I can hear this water running, hold on
Is that water still on?
That's not me
Oh, it's not? (Woah)
Could you be both aliens?
You want me to be both aliens?
Just say, say
"You know what place blows? Earth"
"I agree
You know what place blows? Earth
I agree, grab the sack, let's go to Mars"
We're such losers
That's why we gotta leave Earth, man
"Don't forget, bring the weed"
“lonely”
[Verse 1]
I got in trouble
The first time my dad saw me
Dance with the devil
How are we so opposite?
I lived with your sister
My first home since Mom had left
And I wrote my first song with him in the basement

[Pre-Chorus]
And then he said goodbye way too soon
And this don't feel right without you

[Chorus]
Lonely, lonely, even when the room is full
I'd trade it, trade it, I would trade it all for you
Lonely, lonely, even when the room is full
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely without you

[Verse 2]
I got in trouble
The first time the cops saw me
Dance with the devil
I ended up in handcuffs and then
You called your sister
She cried when she picked me up
Goddamn, how I miss her
'Cause she didn't give a fuck
